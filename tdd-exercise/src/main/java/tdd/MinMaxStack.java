 * Task 2 - TDD for Min Max Stack
 * A stack that supports retrieving the minimum and maximum values in constant time.
 * A stack is a data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.
 * Therefore, giving a stack [1, 2, 3], the first element to be removed is 3, then 2, and finally 1.
 * When adding elements, like 4, the stack becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].
 * NB!! You should not call Collections.min or Collections.max to get the min/max values.
